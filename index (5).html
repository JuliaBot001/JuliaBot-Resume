        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Julia Bot and I am a first year student studying Sociology at UCR. I plan to soon switch into a major for Psychology. I believe this major will provide me with more job opportunities zeroed in on the main thing about psychology that I am interested in. I am passionate about studying the social and personal behaviors of individuals and societies as a whole, given my interest in these two majors. I am hoping my further education will provide me with ample opportunities to be able to find a sustainable job in either of these fields. I am commuting to the school and am interested in finding jobs around the school or near my home. I have always had a passion for understanding people and learning how to help and contain some behaviors expressed by those in times of crisis. I enjoy being a compassionate listener and am always willing to give out a helping hand and suggest what I believe to be the right thing in any given situation.  <br><br>

        I do not have frequent free time as I am often busy taking care of myself, my school responsibilities, and my work responsibilities. I am very dedicated to anything I do, and tend to prioritize anything made out to me to be important, even if it is not as important as other things I may have going on. I always make time to help people out, even if it means I will fall behind slightly in a task for myself. I never do things out of self-benefit, and am always looking at the greater good for everyone around me. I am very friendly and hardworking, and am a very easy person to get along with in any given environment or situation. I love new experiences, working hard, being dedicated to everyone around me, and helping out others whenever possible. <br><br>

       I have had some past job experiences, all of which having been in a restaurant or a fast food environment. I have worked in a place called Dickey’s BBQ, Griddle Mongolian Grill, and am currently working at a place called Polly’s Pies. I have had the opportunity to experience first hand counting money, interacting with customers, cleaning up after customers, seating customers, and dealing with people who are dissatisfied with their services. I have also had the opportunity to learn from those who I am working with to improve my on the job skills and use the resources I am provided when I am in need of any kind of assistance. I have had much experience with assisting managers with more difficult tasks and situations, and have often been applauded for my efforts to go the extra mile in the workplace. I am a hard and determined worker, and hate to feel as though I could have done a better job in any situation. I believe one should be passionate while working, and dedicated to making the workplace a better environment for both the customers and employees alike.
